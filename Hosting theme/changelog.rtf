-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Please be sure to read the Important Update Notes before you update:\
I am always proactive in preventing security issues, however nobody can assume they will never come up.\
This is why I highly recommend to stay up to date with each new template version. \
\
There is no way to automatically update, is true! You should check the change-log posted on the item page or the change-log file inside the Antler folder after downloaded. If you need to customize the Antler Template to your liking and style, you should use "custom" files (custom.css & custom.js). So, you can added and replace all files or code lines updated, following the change-log file without losing your configurations already implemented.\
